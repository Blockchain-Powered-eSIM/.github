Welcome to the Blockchain Powered eSIM,
_Blockchain Powered eSIM is an idea of building an **Open Source eSIM** using **modern cryptography, blockchain, telecommunication and mobile computing** for better UX and mass adoption._ 
_The motivation of this project is to **enhance the user experience comprehensively across all dimensions**._
As the intersection of mobile telecommunications and blockchain technology, a new paradigm, we are dedicated to utilies:  
- The way mobile devices connect and interact with networks globally for **mass adoption**,
- Blockchains that offers **immutability and transperancy with ownership**,
- Modern cryptography for **data integrity**,

Resulting in **allowing users to do more than just communicate**  

_We are currently building an [eSIM Wallet](https://github.com/Blockchain-Powered-eSIM/eSIM) mobile application._  

We have created a few set of wikis and will keep updating them for better understanding: 
- **[eSIM and Key Integration Point](https://github.com/Blockchain-Powered-eSIM/eSIM-Wallet/wiki/eSIM-and-Key-Integration-Point)**
- **[eSIM Wallet Mobile App](https://github.com/Blockchain-Powered-eSIM/eSIM-Wallet/wiki)**
- **[Key Management](https://github.com/Blockchain-Powered-eSIM/eSIM-Wallet/wiki/Key-Management)**
- **[Smart Contract Suite](https://github.com/Blockchain-Powered-eSIM/smart-contract-suite)**
