# Blockchain Powered eSIM
This is the official organisation for Blockchain Powered eSIM, created by [Arpit](https://github.com/ArpitxGit) , [Manul](https://gtihub.com/ManulParihar) & [Tanmay](https://github.com/GuyPhy) , feel free to reach out via [email](arpitxdungeon@gmail.com) , [telegram](https://t.me/dungexn) or [discord](https://discord.com/users/dungeon_master4227).

Welcome to the Blockchain Powered eSIM,
Blockchain Powered eSIM is an idea of building an **Open Source eSIM(**embedded SIM**) to contribute** in improving consumer network connectivity and digital well being of mobile users**,** leveraging 

- **Modern cryptography(privacy persevering cryptographic techniques),**
- **Blockchain(Smart contracts, distributed ledgers & decentralised network),**
- **Telecommunication and mobile computing(eSIM, Passkeys)**

With ethos of **open source**, the potential for cross technology integration co-benefits industries in solving various problems with mass adoption respectively.

The motivation behind this project is to **enhance the user experience comprehensively across all dimensions**.
As the intersection of mobile telecom and blockchain technology, a new paradigm, we are dedicated to utilise:

- The way mobile devices connect and interacts with networks globally for **mass adoption**,
- Blockchains that offers **immutability and transparency with ownership**,
- Modern cryptography to **improve sensitive information sharing and authentication of/in-between different persona** ,

Resulting in an secure open source ecosystem where various entity can collaborate with sustainable infrastructure sharing to deliver the best possible connectivity to users and simultaneously allowing users to do more than just communicate.

We have created a simple and easy to understand write up of our work in a few set of wikis and repositories which we are continuously updating:

### eSIM Wikis

> Everything about eSIM(embedded SIM cards)

- [Remote SIM Provisioning(RSP)](https://github.com/Blockchain-Powered-eSIM/eSIM-Wallet/wiki/Remote-SIM-Provisioning)

### Protocol

> Open source smart wallet(self custodial & device bound) for payments to cover operator-customer payment scenarios, & customer to customer international remittances.

- [eSIM Wallet Smart Contract Suite](https://github.com/Blockchain-Powered-eSIM/smart-contract-suite)

### Application

> Android eSIM-Wallet app developed to create eSIM based wallets which allow users to interact with blockchain.

- [eSIM Wallet](https://github.com/Blockchain-Powered-eSIM/eSIM-Wallet)

> Consumer mobile app to purchase eSIM data plans and subscriptions using crypto, cards or digital wallets in 200+ countries with special and cheap regional plans.
