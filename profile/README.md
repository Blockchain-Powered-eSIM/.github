Welcome to the Blockchain Powered eSIM,
_Blockchain Powered eSIM is an idea of building an **Open Source eSIM** using **modern cryptography, blockchain, telecommunication and mobile computing** for better UX and mass adoption in modern technology._ 
_The motivation of this project is to **enhance the user experience comprehensively across all dimensions**._
As the intersection of mobile telecommunications and blockchain technology, a new paradigm, we are dedicated to utilies:  
- The way mobile devices connect and interact with networks globally for **mass adoption**,
- Blockchains that offers **immutability and transperancy with ownership**,
- Modern cryptography for **data integrity**,

Resulting in **allowing users to do more than just communicate**  

_We are currently building an [eSIM Wallet](https://github.com/Blockchain-Powered-eSIM/eSIM-Wallet) mobile application and working on [open source remote sim provisioning protocol](https://github.com/Blockchain-Powered-eSIM/OpenRSP)._  

We have created a simple and easy to understand write up of our work in a few set of wikis and repositories which we are continuosly updating: 

### eSIM Wikis
